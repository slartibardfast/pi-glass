Tradeoffs: These Guidelines bias towards caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

0. "Work as if you live in the early days of a better nation".

1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

No features beyond what was asked.
No abstractions for single-use code.
No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
No error handling for impossible scenarios.
If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.
When your changes create orphans:

Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

4. Security: No HTTP Input to Disk
This is a hard design constraint, not a guideline.

No data from an HTTP request may ever be written to the server's filesystem.
The web UI is read-only. Config is loaded at startup; there is no admin interface.
The Windows bootstrap copy (exe-adjacent config.toml) is a local filesystem operation — not triggered by any HTTP request.
If a feature would require writing HTTP-sourced data to disk, reject the design and propose a read-only alternative.
